You somehow dont get caught and make it to your car. You speed off towards your house,
unfortunately you dont make it far without your car running out of gas. You end up at the mall,
its abandoned. You decide to search for supplies. You make it to the food court and find some water and food,
you also find a kitchen knife. You eat the food and with a full stomach you head towards the security office
hoping to find a weapon when suddenly you hear a loud screech.
Its a zombie and its conveniently right in front of the security office, just great.

You need to get in there, what do you do?
1) Try to sneak past.
2) Try to take it head on.
3) Distract it with a nearby toy to lead it away from the door.
